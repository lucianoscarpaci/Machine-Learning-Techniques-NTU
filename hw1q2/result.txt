Optimal solution found.
Bias (b): -9.000000174535527
Weights (w): [ 2.00000004e+00 -2.04483870e-10]

hyperplane equation is: w1z1 + w2z2 + b = 0
b = -9.000000174535527
w1 = 2.00000004
w2 = -2.04483870 x 10^-10 ~ 0.0
Substitute z2 as zero:
w1z1 + b = 0
z1 = -b/w1 = 4.5000000872677635

Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the hyperplane equation simplifies to z1 = 4.5 when z2 is set to zero. This confirms the hyperplane at z1 = 4.5
